# WeatherApp 

WeatherApp is a simple weather web application that will let you check the current weather of a specific city using ReactJS and Tailwind for layout and design. 

## Designs and Layout

Before the implementation, all of the designs and layout are created in figma. Here's the [link](https://www.figma.com/design/c88aPhtMth5AfPTlcpPQVo/WeatherApp---React?node-id=0-1&t=v2Hag6vCnF7GBAta-0) for the design's figma.
